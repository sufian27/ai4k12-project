*****Priority high*****
1) change locolstorage of dataset to flask parameter parsing
2) another static view of clustering result
3) regenerate images for example 1 2 3 and comment the process of download images for different users
4) k nearest and vote
6) a button to reselect example easily


*Priority low*
2) change locolstorage of mapping rule to flask parameter parsing
3) Refresh introduction page, the page will return "invalid data"
4) http://127.0.0.1:5000/favicon.ico 404 (NOT FOUND)
3) "/var" logic.js:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'LOGIC_VERSION' has already been declared at VM88 logic.js:1
7) How about create a txt file in the root and all the user id in the txt file (each in a row) will be added to the database and only the id on the file can log in
10) create a global var in app.py to identify the image path "image/which user/which example"
11) only when view_all_faces is clicked, all the images are generated and can be used
12) bug: first click compare faces then before click view all faces button
13) redo dataset database for final study

14) Modification: log in directly after add new users.
16) use yaml.safe_load makes the loading of introduction page very slow
